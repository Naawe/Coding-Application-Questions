This code contains three functions the first "number_guessing_game" could be considered the main function through which the game is initiated
and it calls the other functions. The purpose of this function is to continually prompt the player until they get the right answer, then it
ends the game. It in turn calls "valid_input" which takes a number from the user, makes sure its a valid guess and then returns it. Then
it calls "check_guess" which checks if the validated input is higher, lower or equal to the target number printing out the result and then
returning True or False if it returns True back to the main function "number_guessing_game" then the loop breaks and the game ends.
